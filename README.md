# SIR-Simulation

- Implemented a Python-based visual simulation of a virus spreading in a population. You can use the UI to change different factors that affect the spread of the virus such as the infection rate, initial infected population, and initial recovered population.
- The application graphs the susceptible, infected, and recovered population overtime after a simulation finishes (no one is infected) using the Matplotlib library.
- The simulation accurately depicts the SIR model based on the graphs.
